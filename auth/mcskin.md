## Info about using my Minecraft skin

I drew my first Minecraft skin from scratch a couple of years ago, but I have replaced it with another one. There is "new skin" and "old skin" and usage rules are not completely the same.

### The new skin

Right now at the creation of this page, I'm using a skin drawn by myself showing the figure of the hero in a Minecraft animation -- *Find the Pieces* (which is a part of *Fallen Kingdom* series animation). This one is the "new skin".

The character doesn't belong to me -- but the skin I've created is still CC-BY-SA 4.0 licensed to you, mostly free to use for anyone who wants to make creations, except for the following occasions:

- Claiming it;
- NSFW content, this includes sex related, massive amount of gore, etc.
- Using it commercially with no author credits included;
- Any other situations I would not agree to allow the use.

### The old skin

Some of you might be holding my old skin (which have been replaced). This skin file is also available under CC-BY-SA 4.0, with similar rules to the new skin, but the following rules will also apply:

- Contact me and get my permission before having me (i.e. my old Minecraft skin) involved in a commercial project; however, if the project is a commision from others, you will not have to do so;
- Credit my Minecraft ID **RigoLigo** with your creation if possible.

### Objections

If you feel one or more of my rules is not reasonable, please open an issue in the repository issues page.
